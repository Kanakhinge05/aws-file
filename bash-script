What is Bash scripting?
Concept (short):
 Bash scripting is writing a file of Bash commands (text) so the computer runs them one after another. It automates tasks you’d otherwise type by hand.
What (details):
Bash = the shell program that reads commands.


Script = a plain text file with commands and logic (variables, conditions, loops).


Filename usually ends .sh but can be anything.


Why (importance):
Automates repetitive work (backups, installs, tests).


Makes tasks reproducible and shareable.


Teaches programming basics (flow control, variables).


Let’s Understand (analogy):
 Think of a Bash script as a recipe. The shell is the cook that reads the recipe line by line and does each step.
